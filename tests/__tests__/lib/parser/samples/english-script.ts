INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cozy neighborhood coffee shop. JOHN (30s, tired) sits at a corner table with his laptop.

MARY enters, spots John, and walks over.

MARY
(surprised)
John? Is that really you?

JOHN
(looking up)
Mary! What a surprise!

MARY
(sitting down)
I haven't seen you in years. How have you been?

JOHN
Busy with work, as always. You?

MARY
Same here. Still teaching at the university.

John closes his laptop.

JOHN
Can I buy you a coffee?

MARY
(smiling)
That would be nice.

CUT TO:

EXT. PARK - LATER

John and Mary walk through the park, coffee cups in hand.

MARY
Remember when we used to come here after class?

JOHN
(nostalgic)
How could I forget? Those were simpler times.

They sit on a bench.

FADE OUT.`
