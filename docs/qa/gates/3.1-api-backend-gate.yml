    notes: |
      Exceptional implementation of API backend infrastructure.
      Security enhancements make this production-ready.
      Minor test issues are environmental, not functional.
      Approved for production deployment.

conclusion: |
  Story 3.1 has successfully implemented a robust, secure, and scalable API backend
  infrastructure that exceeds all acceptance criteria. The implementation demonstrates
  enterprise-level architecture with comprehensive middleware, proper error handling,
  and excellent documentation. Security enhancements during QA review have elevated
  the solution beyond initial requirements. The system is production-ready and provides
  a solid foundation for future stories.
