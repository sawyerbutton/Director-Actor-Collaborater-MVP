notes: |
  Excellent work addressing all critical issues from the initial review:
  
  1. Redis-based rate limiting implemented with intelligent fallback to in-memory
     storage for development/testing environments
  2. WSL environment configuration automated in setup script
  3. Playwright webServer configuration enabled for automated E2E testing
  
  The implementation is now production-ready with proper scalability and security.
  The fallback mechanism ensures the system remains functional even if Redis is
  unavailable, while still providing production-grade rate limiting when deployed.
  
  All acceptance criteria have been met and verified.
