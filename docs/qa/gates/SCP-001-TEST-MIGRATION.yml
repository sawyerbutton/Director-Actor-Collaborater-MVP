migration_risks:
  - risk: 'Tests may already be partially migrated'
    impact: low
    mitigation: 'Verify current state before changes'
  - risk: 'Type errors may cascade'
    impact: medium
    mitigation: 'Use incremental compilation and testing'
  - risk: 'Mock factories may need updates'
    impact: low
    mitigation: 'Already exist and appear compatible'

validation_checklist:
  pre_migration:
    - 'Run npx tsc --noEmit to baseline errors'
    - 'Document current test failure count'
    - 'Create git branch for migration'
  during_migration:
    - 'Migrate one file at a time'
    - 'Run type check after each file'
    - 'Commit working changes frequently'
  post_migration:
    - 'Run full test suite'
    - 'Compare error counts'
    - 'Document any remaining issues'
