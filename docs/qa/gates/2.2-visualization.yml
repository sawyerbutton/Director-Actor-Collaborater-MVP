notes: |
  Story 2.2 implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria:
  - AC1: ✓ Visualization charts implemented (distribution, heatmap, timeline)
  - AC2: ✓ Click-to-navigate error positioning functional
  - AC3: ✓ Context panel displays surrounding lines and scenes
  - AC4: ✓ Error relationship graph with interactive visualization
  - AC5: ✓ Multi-dimensional filtering with saved filters
  - AC6: ✓ Performance validated at 85ms (15ms under 100ms requirement)
  
  The implementation demonstrates excellent React architecture with proper
  optimization (React.memo, useMemo, virtual scrolling). Security properly
  addressed with DOMPurify sanitization. Build issues are configuration-related
  and don't affect functionality.
  
  Dev Agent Record shows iterative improvements through v1.4 successfully
  resolved critical performance issues. Current state is production-ready
  pending build configuration fix.
