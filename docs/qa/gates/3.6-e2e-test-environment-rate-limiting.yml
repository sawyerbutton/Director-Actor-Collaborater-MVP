notes: |
  The implementation successfully addresses all acceptance criteria but has a critical 
  architectural issue with the rate limiter using in-memory storage. This MUST be 
  replaced with a distributed cache (Redis/Memcached) before production deployment.
  
  The WSL environment configuration is functional but requires manual setup steps
  that should be automated for better developer experience.
  
  Test coverage is good but E2E tests cannot be fully validated without running
  the development server manually.
