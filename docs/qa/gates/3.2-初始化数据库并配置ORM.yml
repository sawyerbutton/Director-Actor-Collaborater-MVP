gate_decision_rationale: |
  Story 3.2 passes the quality gate with an implementation score of 91/100. 
  The implementation is exceptional with production-ready code. Key achievements:
  
  1. Prisma schema perfectly implemented with all three models
  2. Service layer architecture with outstanding error handling
  3. Database client singleton with health monitoring
  4. Complex transaction support for atomic operations
  5. Comprehensive test coverage (26 tests, all passing)
  6. Complete operational documentation
  7. Security and performance considerations addressed
  
  Only pending item is the actual database migration which requires 
  Supabase connection configuration. This is an operational task, not a code issue.
  
  The implementation exceeds expectations and provides an excellent foundation
  for the application's data layer.
