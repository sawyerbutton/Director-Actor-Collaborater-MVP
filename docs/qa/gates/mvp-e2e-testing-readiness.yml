# Waiver not active - issues need addressing
waiver: { active: false }

# Risk assessment based on test coverage gaps
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0  # No critical risks if P0 tests implemented
    high: 2      # TEST-001, PERF-001
    medium: 3    # ENV-001, TEST-002, SEC-001
    low: 1       # REL-001
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Implement P0 E2E tests (20 scenarios) before production release"
      - "Validate <10 second performance requirement with actual E2E tests"
      - "Confirm WSL Playwright setup works with headless Chrome"
    monitor:
      - "Track test execution time to stay within 15-20 minute target"
      - "Monitor memory usage in WSL environment during test runs"
      - "Watch for flaky tests due to async operations"

# Quality metrics

  implement_p1_tests: "2 days"
  implement_p2_tests: "1 day"
  total_estimate: "5-6 days for full E2E suite"

# Success criteria for gate approval
gate_approval_criteria:
  - "All 20 P0 tests implemented and passing"
  - "<10 second analysis performance validated"
  - "WSL Playwright environment confirmed working"
  - "Security tests (CSRF/XSS) passing"
  - "No data loss in E2E scenarios"

# Gate decision summary
summary: |
  The E2E test design is comprehensive and well-structured with 45 test scenarios covering
  all critical user journeys. However, the gate status is CONCERNS because:
  
  1. No tests are currently implemented despite 100% story completion
  2. Critical performance requirement (<10s analysis) remains unvalidated
  3. WSL environment setup needs confirmation
  4. 32 unit test failures need resolution first
  
  Recommendation: Proceed with immediate P0 test implementation (20 scenarios) to validate
  MVP readiness. The test design provides excellent foundation, but execution is required
  before production release.
