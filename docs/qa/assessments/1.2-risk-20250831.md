## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Script Injection Vulnerability

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - User-provided text input without proper sanitization
**Impact**: High - Could lead to XSS attacks or code injection when parsed content is displayed
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict input sanitization for all script text
- HTML encode all output before rendering
- Use a content security policy (CSP)
- Validate against script/HTML tags in input
**Testing Focus**: 
- Test with malicious script payloads
- Verify all special characters are properly escaped
- Test HTML/JavaScript injection attempts

## High Priority Risks

### 2. TECH-001: Complex Parsing Logic

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Script formats vary widely across languages and styles
**Impact**: Medium - Incorrect parsing leads to wrong analysis results
**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust pattern matching with fallback strategies
- Create comprehensive regex patterns for different formats
- Add manual override/correction capabilities
- Implement confidence scoring for parse results
**Testing Focus**: 
- Test with various script format styles
- Verify edge cases and non-standard formats
- Test fallback mechanisms

### 3. PERF-001: Performance with Large Scripts

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Users may upload full-length movie scripts
**Impact**: High - Parser could timeout or freeze browser
**Mitigation**:
- Implement streaming/chunked parsing
- Add progress indicators for long operations
- Set maximum file size limits
- Use Web Workers for parsing if needed
**Testing Focus**:
- Load test with large script files (>100 pages)
- Measure parsing time and memory usage
- Test timeout handling

### 4. DATA-001: Character Encoding Issues

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Mixed Chinese/English content with various encodings
**Impact**: High - Garbled text leads to parsing failures
**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust encoding detection
- Normalize to UTF-8 before parsing
- Handle BOM (Byte Order Mark) properly
- Test with various encoding formats
**Testing Focus**:
- Test with different character encodings
- Verify Chinese character handling
- Test mixed language scripts

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Security Testing Suite**
  - Script injection prevention tests
  - XSS vulnerability scanning
  - Input sanitization verification
  - Output encoding validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Parser Robustness Suite**
  - Various script format tests
  - Character encoding tests
  - Large file performance tests
  - Edge case handling

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Integration Testing Suite**
  - End-to-end parsing flows
  - Data structure validation
  - Metadata generation
  - Error recovery mechanisms

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: Input sanitization must be implemented
- TECH-001: Core parsing patterns must handle standard formats
- DATA-001: UTF-8 normalization must work correctly

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- PERF-001: File size limits as temporary measure
- TECH-002: Timeout protections in place
- DATA-002: Validation warnings for users

### Accepted Risks
- TECH-003: Manual correction as fallback (document for users)
- PERF-002: Monitor in production

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Metrics**: Blocked injection attempts, suspicious inputs
- **Performance Metrics**: Parse times, memory usage, timeouts
- **Quality Metrics**: Parse failure rates, confidence scores
- **Data Metrics**: Encoding errors, data loss incidents

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New script formats need support
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported
- Parsing accuracy complaints increase
- File upload limits need adjustment

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Implement comprehensive input sanitization
2. Add encoding detection and normalization
3. Create performance benchmarks and limits

### Testing Focus Areas
1. Security testing with malicious inputs
2. Performance testing with large files
3. Character encoding compatibility tests
4. Format variation coverage

### Architectural Considerations
1. Consider using a parsing library vs custom regex
2. Implement progressive enhancement for complex formats
3. Design for extensibility to add new format patterns
4. Plan for caching parsed results
