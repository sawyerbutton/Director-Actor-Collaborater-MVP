# Risk Profile: Story 1.1 - DeepSeek API Integration

Date: 2025-08-31
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 56/100 (Moderate-High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: API Key Exposure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - API keys are often accidentally exposed in client-side code, version control, or logs
**Impact**: High - Exposed keys could lead to unauthorized API usage, financial loss, and data breach
**Mitigation**:
- Store API keys exclusively in server-side environment variables
- Never include API keys in client-side code or frontend bundles
- Implement key rotation mechanism
- Add .env files to .gitignore
- Use environment variable validation on startup
**Testing Focus**: 
- Security scan for exposed secrets in codebase
- Review build artifacts for embedded keys
- Test error messages don't leak sensitive configuration

## High Priority Risks

### 2. SEC-002: Insufficient Validation of AI Responses

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - AI responses can contain unexpected content or prompt injections
**Impact**: High - Could lead to XSS, code injection, or manipulation of application behavior
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict output validation and sanitization
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Escape all AI-generated content before rendering
- Implement response schema validation
**Testing Focus**: 
- Test with malicious prompt attempts
- Validate HTML/script injection prevention
- Test response format validation

### 3. PERF-001: API Rate Limiting

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - DeepSeek API has rate limits that will be hit under load
**Impact**: Medium - Service degradation but not complete failure
**Mitigation**:
- Implement request queue with priority management
- Add exponential backoff retry logic
- Cache frequently requested responses
- Monitor rate limit headers
**Testing Focus**:
- Load testing to identify rate limit thresholds
- Test queue behavior under pressure
- Validate graceful degradation

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| SEC-001 | Security | API key exposure | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Preventive: Server-side only storage |
| SEC-002 | Security | Response injection vulnerability | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | Preventive: Output sanitization |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Rate limiting issues | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | Detective: Queue management |
| TECH-001 | Technical | Vendor lock-in | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Preventive: Abstraction layer |
| DATA-001 | Data | Request/response data loss | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Corrective: Retry mechanism |
| OPS-001 | Operational | Monitoring gaps | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Detective: Implement logging |
| BUS-001 | Business | API cost overrun | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Detective: Usage monitoring |
| TECH-002 | Technical | Type mismatches | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Preventive: TypeScript validation |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Security Testing Suite**
  - Secret scanning in all code and config files
  - Environment variable exposure tests
  - API key rotation verification
  - CSP header validation
  - XSS prevention tests on AI responses

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Testing Suite**
  - Rate limit threshold identification
  - Queue overflow scenarios
  - Concurrent request handling
  - Retry mechanism validation
  - Response time under load

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Integration Testing Suite**
  - Error handling coverage
  - TypeScript type validation
  - Configuration loading tests
  - Logging and monitoring verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: API key must be properly secured server-side
- SEC-002: Response validation must be implemented
- PERF-001: Rate limiting handler must be functional

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-001: Abstraction layer provides sufficient decoupling
- DATA-001: Retry mechanism handles transient failures
- OPS-001: Basic logging in place, enhanced monitoring can follow

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-001: Cost monitoring alerts configured (accept initial risk)
- TECH-002: TypeScript provides compile-time safety (minimal runtime risk)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Metrics**: Failed auth attempts, suspicious payloads
- **Performance Metrics**: API response times, rate limit hits, queue depth
- **Error Rates**: API failures, retry counts, timeout frequency
- **Business KPIs**: API usage costs, request volumes

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- DeepSeek API updates or changes pricing
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in dependencies
- Performance issues reported in production
- New AI features or models integrated
- Regulatory requirements for AI systems change

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Implement secure API key management using environment variables
2. Add comprehensive input/output validation for AI responses
3. Set up rate limiting handler with queue management

### Testing Focus Areas
1. Security testing for credential exposure
2. Load testing for rate limit behavior
3. Injection attack testing on AI responses

### Architectural Considerations
1. Consider implementing circuit breaker pattern for API failures
2. Design caching strategy for frequent AI requests
3. Plan for multi-provider support in abstraction layer

**Risk Score Calculation**:
- Base Score: 100
- Critical risks (1 × 20): -20
- High risks (2 × 10): -20
- Medium risks (3 × 5): -15
- Low risks (1 × 2): -2
- **Final Score: 56/100**

This indicates a moderate-high risk profile requiring focused mitigation efforts before production deployment.
