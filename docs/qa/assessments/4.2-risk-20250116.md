## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 12
- Critical Risks: 3
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 4
- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 29/100 (High Risk - Significant security and operational concerns)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Complete Security Exposure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Will definitely occur once auth is removed
**Impact**: High (3) - Entire application exposed without access control
**Mitigation**:
- Document this as intentional for demo environment only
- Add clear warning banners about demo/non-production status
- Implement network-level restrictions (IP allowlisting)
- Deploy to isolated demo environment only
**Testing Focus**:
- Verify warning banners are prominent
- Test network restrictions work as intended
- Confirm no production data is accessible

### 2. DATA-001: Unprotected Data Access

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - All data becomes publicly accessible
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete data exposure risk
**Mitigation**:
- Use synthetic/demo data only
- Separate demo database from any production systems
- Implement data sanitization before demo deployment
- Regular audit of exposed data
**Testing Focus**:
- Verify no PII or sensitive data present
- Test data isolation from production
- Validate demo data generation process

### 3. BUS-001: Production Deployment Risk

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Configuration could be mistakenly deployed
**Impact**: High (3) - Catastrophic if deployed to production
**Mitigation**:
- Clear environment separation in deployment configs
- Multiple deployment safeguards and checks
- Prominent "DEMO ONLY" markers in codebase
- Separate branch/repository for demo version
**Testing Focus**:
- Test deployment pipeline prevents production deployment
- Verify environment checks are enforced
- Validate build warnings for demo mode

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Environment Verification Tests**
  - Confirm deployment environment is marked as DEMO
  - Verify no production endpoints are accessible
  - Test network isolation and IP restrictions

- **Data Exposure Tests**
  - Scan for PII or sensitive data patterns
  - Verify all data is synthetic/demo quality
  - Test database isolation from production

- **Security Boundary Tests**
  - Attempt to access admin functions
  - Test for CSRF vulnerabilities
  - Verify no auth tokens are processed

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **API Abuse Tests**
  - Load testing without rate limiting
  - Resource exhaustion testing
  - Concurrent request handling

- **Code Cleanup Tests**
  - Static analysis for dead code
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - TypeScript compilation without errors

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **UI/UX Tests**
  - Verify demo banners are visible
  - Test all routes are accessible
  - Check for console errors/warnings

- **Build Pipeline Tests**
  - Clean build without warnings
  - Successful deployment to demo environment
  - Health check endpoint functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Demo Deployment
- Clear "DEMO ONLY" indicators throughout application
- Network-level access restrictions configured
- All production data removed/sanitized
- Deployment safeguards preventing production push

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Rate limiting at infrastructure level
- Basic monitoring for demo environment
- Documentation of known limitations

### Accepted Risks
- No user access control (intentional for demo)
- Public data visibility (using demo data only)
- Potential for API abuse (mitigated by network restrictions)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Metrics**
  - Unusual traffic patterns
  - API abuse attempts
  - Data access patterns

- **Operational Metrics**
  - Application health and uptime
  - Resource utilization
  - Error rates and types

- **Business Metrics**
  - Demo usage statistics
  - User engagement with demo
  - Feedback collection

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Moving from demo to any authenticated version
- Adding real or sensitive data
- Expanding deployment beyond demo environment
- Integrating with external services
- Significant architecture changes

## Recommendations Summary

### Must Fix
1. Add prominent "DEMO ONLY - NO AUTHENTICATION" warnings
2. Implement network-level access restrictions
3. Ensure complete data sanitization
4. Create deployment safeguards against production

### Should Monitor
1. API usage patterns for abuse
2. Resource consumption trends
3. Any attempts to inject real data
4. Error logs for security-related issues

### Nice to Have
1. Rate limiting at application level
2. Basic usage analytics
3. Automated security scanning
4. Demo reset automation
