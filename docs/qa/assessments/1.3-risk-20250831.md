## Review Date: 2025-08-31
## Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|--------|------------|
| **Incomplete Error Detection** | High (8/10) | High (8/10) | 64 | Complete implementation of detection methods |
| **API Rate Limiting** | Medium (5/10) | Medium (6/10) | 30 | Implemented concurrency control and caching |
| **Memory Leaks** | Low (2/10) | High (8/10) | 16 | ✓ Fixed with cache size limits |
| **Security Exposure** | Low (2/10) | Critical (10/10) | 20 | ✓ Fixed with sanitized logging |
| **Performance Degradation** | Low (3/10) | Medium (5/10) | 15 | ✓ Mitigated with parallel processing |

## Critical Risks

### 1. Incomplete Error Detection Logic
**Risk Level**: HIGH (Score: 64)
- **Description**: Core error detection methods not implemented
- **Impact**: System may fail to detect critical script inconsistencies
- **Affected Components**: 
  - `lib/agents/error-detector.ts`
  - Timeline validation
  - Plot logic validation
- **Mitigation Required**: 
  - Implement `isTimeReferenceProblematic` method
  - Implement `isCausalChainValid` method
  - Update and verify all related tests

### 2. Test Coverage Gaps
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (Score: 30)
- **Description**: 4 tests failing; no integration tests
- **Impact**: Undetected bugs may reach production
- **Affected Components**: Error detection test suite
- **Mitigation**: Fix failing tests and add integration test coverage

## Mitigated Risks

### 1. Security Vulnerability (RESOLVED)
- **Original Risk**: Information leakage through error logs
- **Resolution**: Implemented environment-aware sanitized logging
- **Residual Risk**: None

### 2. Memory Management (RESOLVED)
- **Original Risk**: Unbounded cache growth
- **Resolution**: Implemented LRU cache with TTL and size limits
- **Residual Risk**: None

### 3. Performance Bottleneck (RESOLVED)
- **Original Risk**: Sequential API calls causing delays
- **Resolution**: Parallel processing with concurrency control
- **Residual Risk**: Low - monitor API rate limits in production

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete error detection implementations
2. Fix failing unit tests
3. Add integration test suite

### Monitoring Requirements
1. Track API response times
2. Monitor cache hit rates
3. Log error detection accuracy metrics

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement ML-based error detection
2. Add self-learning capabilities
3. Create feedback loop for detection accuracy

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Current Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Critical security and performance risks addressed
- Core functionality incomplete in error detection
- Requires immediate attention to detection logic

**Post-Mitigation Risk Level**: LOW
- All critical issues can be resolved with identified actions
- Strong foundation with good architecture
