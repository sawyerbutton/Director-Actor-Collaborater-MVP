Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 12
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 36/100 (High Risk - Requires significant mitigation)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: File Upload Vulnerability - Arbitrary File Execution
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - File upload without proper validation is a common attack vector
**Impact**: High - Could lead to remote code execution, data breach, or system compromise
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict file type validation (whitelist only .txt/.docx)
- Scan uploaded files for malicious content
- Store uploads in isolated storage with no execution permissions
- Implement file size limits and rate limiting
**Testing Focus**: Security penetration testing with malicious file uploads

### 2. PERF-001: Unbounded Polling Leading to DDoS
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High - Multiple users polling status without limits can overwhelm server
**Impact**: High - System could become unresponsive, affecting all users
**Mitigation**:
- Implement exponential backoff in polling mechanism
- Add maximum polling duration timeout
- Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events instead of polling
- Implement rate limiting on status check endpoints
**Testing Focus**: Load testing with concurrent polling scenarios

## High Risk Issues

### 3. DATA-001: Analysis Results Data Loss
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Cache-only storage without persistence
**Impact**: High - Users lose analysis results on refresh/navigation
**Mitigation**:
- Persist analysis results to database
- Implement proper session storage
- Add recovery mechanisms for interrupted analyses

### 4. SEC-002: Missing CSRF Protection
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Next.js provides some protection but needs configuration
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized actions performed on user's behalf
**Mitigation**:
- Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
- Configure Next.js security headers properly
- Validate request origins

### 5. TECH-001: Missing Error Boundaries
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Complex UI without error handling
**Impact**: Medium - Entire page crashes on component errors
**Mitigation**:
- Implement React Error Boundaries
- Add fallback UI for error states
- Log errors for monitoring

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Security Test Suite**:
  - Upload malicious files (executables, scripts, oversized)
  - Test file type bypass techniques
  - Verify MIME type validation
  - Test path traversal in filenames
  
- **Performance Test Suite**:
  - Concurrent polling simulation (100+ users)
  - Long-running analysis timeout behavior
  - Network failure during polling
  - Memory usage during extended polling

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests  
- **Data Integrity Tests**:
  - Browser refresh during analysis
  - Multiple tab scenarios
  - Session expiration handling
  
- **Error Recovery Tests**:
  - Component failure isolation
  - API failure handling
  - Network disconnection recovery

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Standard functional tests
- UI responsiveness tests
- Accessibility testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: File upload vulnerability
- PERF-001: Unbounded polling issue
- SEC-002: CSRF protection implementation

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- DATA-001: With temporary storage warning to users
- TECH-001: With monitoring and alerting
- PERF-002: With file size limits enforced

### Accepted Risks
- PERF-003: Minor performance optimizations can be deferred
- BUS-001: UX improvements in next iteration

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Metrics**:
  - Failed upload attempts
  - Suspicious file patterns
  - Authentication failures
  
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - API response times
  - Polling frequency per user
  - Memory usage trends
  
- **Error Rates**:
  - Component crash frequency
  - API failure rates
  - Upload success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new file format support
- Changing analysis backend
- Implementing real-time features
- Scaling to more concurrent users
- Security vulnerability discovered in dependencies
