## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Agent Message Loss in Asynchronous Processing

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Asynchronous message passing without proper acknowledgment mechanisms commonly leads to message loss
**Impact**: High - Lost messages between ConsistencyGuardian and RevisionExecutive would result in undetected errors or missing suggestions
**Mitigation**:
- Implement message acknowledgment protocol with retry logic
- Add persistent message queue (Redis/RabbitMQ) for durability
- Create dead letter queue for failed messages
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for agent communication

**Testing Focus**: 
- Chaos testing with random message drops
- Load testing with 1000+ concurrent messages
- Recovery testing after queue failures

### 2. SEC-001: Unvalidated AI-Generated Code Suggestions

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - AI models can generate malicious patterns when prompted incorrectly
**Impact**: High - Direct code execution of AI suggestions could introduce security vulnerabilities
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict output validation for AI responses
- Sandbox execution environment for suggestion validation
- Static analysis on generated suggestions before presentation
- Human review requirement for critical changes

**Testing Focus**:
- Security testing with malicious prompt injection
- SAST analysis on all generated suggestions
- Fuzzing AI inputs with edge cases

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Message Reliability Testing**:
- Implement chaos engineering tests simulating network partitions
- Test message ordering and exactly-once delivery guarantees
- Verify recovery after queue failures
- Load test with 10,000 messages/minute

**Security Testing**:
- Penetration testing on AI suggestion pipeline
- Static analysis on all generated code
- Input fuzzing for prompt injection attacks
- Sandbox escape testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Performance Testing**:
- Load testing revision generation with 100 concurrent requests
- Measure p95 and p99 latencies under load
- Memory profiling for long-running sessions
- API rate limit handling verification

**Data Integrity Testing**:
- Transaction rollback testing
- Audit trail completeness verification
- State consistency validation after failures

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Integration Testing**:
- Agent registration and discovery
- Message format validation
- Error handling pathways
- Monitoring metric accuracy

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001: Implement reliable message delivery with acknowledgments
- SEC-001: Add validation layer for all AI-generated suggestions
- PERF-001: Ensure 90% of requests complete within 10 seconds

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- DATA-001: Deploy with manual backup procedures, automate within 30 days
- OPS-001: Deploy with enhanced logging, add distributed tracing within 2 sprints
- TECH-002: Deploy with static agent registry, dynamic discovery as enhancement

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-002: Accept with user education and clear AI assistance disclaimers
- TECH-004: Accept with TypeScript strict mode and regular type audits

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

**Performance Metrics**:
- Revision generation latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Message queue depth and processing rate
- DeepSeek API response times
- Memory usage trends

**Security Alerts**:
- Suspicious AI prompt patterns
- Authentication failures between agents
- Unexpected code patterns in suggestions

**Operational Metrics**:
- Agent communication success rate
- Message retry counts
- Dead letter queue size
- Error rates by agent type

**Business KPIs**:
- Suggestion acceptance rate
- User satisfaction scores
- Time saved through automation

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new agent types to the collaboration framework
- Changing message passing architecture
- Updating AI model or prompt strategies
- Performance degradation reported in production
- Security vulnerability discovered in dependencies

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Focus on message reliability and security validation first
2. Implement comprehensive integration tests for agent collaboration
3. Add performance benchmarks as regression tests
4. Create chaos testing suite for resilience validation

1. Implement robust error handling and circuit breakers
2. Add comprehensive logging with correlation IDs
3. Create health check endpoints for each agent
4. Design for horizontal scalability from the start

### Deployment Strategy
1. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
2. Deploy with canary releases (5% → 25% → 100%)
3. Implement automated rollback on error rate spikes
4. Maintain previous version for quick reversion

### Monitoring Setup
1. Configure Datadog/New Relic for distributed tracing
2. Set up PagerDuty alerts for critical metrics
3. Create Grafana dashboards for agent collaboration metrics
4. Implement log aggregation with searchable correlation IDs
