## Test Scenarios Mapped to Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: 能够跟踪用户对剧本的修改操作

#### Scenario 1.1: Content Change Tracking
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** High

**Given** a script with existing content  
**When** a user modifies dialogue text in a scene  
**Then** the ChangeTracker should capture the modification event  
**And** record old and new values accurately  
**And** assign correct timestamp and change type  

**Test Data:**
```typescript
const originalDialogue = "Hello, how are you?";
const modifiedDialogue = "Hi there, how's it going?";
```

**Validation Points:**
- ChangeEvent.type === 'content'
- ChangeEvent.oldValue matches original content
- ChangeEvent.newValue matches modified content
- Timestamp within 1 second of actual change

#### Scenario 1.2: Structure Change Tracking
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** High

**Given** a script with existing scene structure  
**When** a user adds or removes a scene  
**Then** the ChangeTracker should detect structural modifications  
**And** identify affected scene dependencies  

**Test Cases:**
- Scene addition at beginning, middle, end
- Scene removal with dependent elements
- Scene reordering operations
- Bulk scene operations

#### Scenario 1.3: Relationship Change Tracking
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** Medium

**Given** a script with character relationships  
**When** character interactions or relationships change  
**Then** the ChangeTracker should capture relationship modifications  
**And** identify cascade effects on related scenes  

**Edge Cases:**
- Character deletion with existing relationships
- New character introduction mid-script
- Relationship type changes (friend to enemy)

### AC2: 识别修改的影响范围（受影响的场景、角色、对话）

#### Scenario 2.1: Direct Impact Analysis
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** High

**Given** a character dialogue modification  
**When** impact analysis is performed  
**Then** the ImpactAnalyzer should identify all scenes containing that character  
**And** mark them as directly impacted  

**Test Matrix:**
| Change Type | Direct Impact | Expected Affected Elements |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Character dialogue | Same scene | Scene, Character, Related dialogues |
| Character name | All scenes with character | All appearances, References |
| Scene description | Same scene | Scene content, Adjacent scenes |
| Plot point | Multiple scenes | Dependent scenes, Character arcs |

#### Scenario 2.2: Indirect Impact Propagation
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** High

**Given** a plot-significant change in Scene A  
**When** impact analysis traces dependencies  
**Then** scenes that reference Scene A events should be marked as indirectly impacted  
**And** propagation paths should be correctly calculated  

**Complex Scenarios:**
- Multi-level dependency chains (A → B → C → D)
- Circular dependencies in character relationships
- Time-sensitive plot element changes
- Cross-scene character development impacts

#### Scenario 2.3: Impact Level Assessment
**Priority:** P2 | **Risk Level:** Medium

**Given** various types of script modifications  
**When** impact analysis calculates severity levels  
**Then** changes should be correctly classified as low/medium/high/critical  

**Classification Rules:**
- **Critical:** Main plot changes, key character death/introduction
- **High:** Major character development, scene order changes
- **Medium:** Dialogue modifications affecting character consistency
- **Low:** Minor description or formatting changes

### AC3: 仅对受影响的部分进行重新分析

#### Scenario 3.1: Selective Re-analysis
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** High

**Given** a script with cached analysis results  
**When** only Scene 3 is modified  
**Then** only Scene 3 and its dependent scenes should be re-analyzed  
**And** unaffected scenes should retain cached results  

**Validation:**
```typescript
// Pseudo-validation code
expect(reanalyzedScenes).toContain('scene-3');
expect(reanalyzedScenes).not.toContain('scene-1'); // if not dependent
expect(cachedResults.get('scene-1')).toBeDefined();
```

#### Scenario 3.2: Dependency-Aware Analysis
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** High

**Given** a change with multi-level dependencies  
**When** incremental analysis is triggered  
**Then** analysis should process dependencies in correct order  
**And** wait for prerequisite analyses to complete  

**Dependency Test Cases:**
- Linear dependency chain: A → B → C
- Fan-out dependencies: A → [B, C, D]
- Diamond dependencies: A → [B, C] → D
- Complex graph with multiple entry points

### AC4: 合并新旧分析结果，保持未受影响部分的分析结果

#### Scenario 4.1: Result Merging Accuracy
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** High

**Given** existing analysis results and new incremental results  
**When** ResultMerger combines the results  
**Then** unchanged elements should retain original analysis  
**And** modified elements should use new analysis  
**And** no data corruption should occur  

**Merge Scenarios:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Merge with no conflicts
  Given old results contain errors for scenes 1-5
  And new results contain errors for scenes 3-4 only
  When results are merged
  Then final result should contain:
    - Original errors for scenes 1,2,5
    - Updated errors for scenes 3,4
    - Correct timestamps for all results

Scenario: Merge with conflict resolution
  Given overlapping error reports with different timestamps
  When conflict resolution is applied
  Then newer analysis should take precedence
  And conflict metadata should be preserved
```

#### Scenario 4.2: Version Management
**Priority:** P2 | **Risk Level:** Medium

**Given** multiple analysis versions for the same element  
**When** version conflicts arise during merging  
**Then** version resolution should follow defined precedence rules  
**And** audit trail should be maintained  

### AC5: 实现增量式分析以优化性能

#### Scenario 5.1: Performance Optimization
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** Critical

**Given** a large script with 50+ scenes  
**When** a single scene is modified  
**Then** analysis completion time should be <2 seconds for small changes  
**And** <5 seconds for medium changes  
**And** <10 seconds for large changes  

**Performance Test Matrix:**
| Script Size | Change Scope | Target Time | Max Acceptable |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| 10 scenes | 1 scene | <1s | 2s |
| 25 scenes | 5 scenes | <3s | 5s |
| 50 scenes | 10 scenes | <5s | 8s |
| 100 scenes | 20 scenes | <8s | 10s |

#### Scenario 5.2: Concurrency and Queuing
**Priority:** P1 | **Risk Level:** High

**Given** multiple concurrent analysis requests  
**When** system processes requests with proper queuing  
**Then** maximum concurrent analyses should not exceed configured limit  
**And** tasks should complete in priority order  
**And** no race conditions should occur  

**Concurrency Tests:**
- 3 concurrent analyses (at limit)
- 5 concurrent requests (exceeds limit)
- Mixed priority task scheduling
- Dependency resolution under load

### AC6: 提供修改前后的对比报告

#### Scenario 6.1: Diff Report Generation
**Priority:** P2 | **Risk Level:** Medium

**Given** analysis results before and after changes  
**When** DiffReportGenerator creates comparison report  
**Then** report should show added, removed, and unchanged issues  
**And** provide clear visual indication of differences  

**Report Validation:**
```typescript
interface ExpectedDiffReport {
  addedIssues: LogicError[];      // New issues introduced
  resolvedIssues: LogicError[];   // Issues fixed by changes
  unchangedIssues: LogicError[];  // Persistent issues
  summary: {
    totalChanges: number;
    criticalChanges: number;
    improvements: number;
    degradations: number;
  };
}
```

#### Scenario 6.2: Change Impact Visualization
**Priority:** P3 | **Risk Level:** Low

**Given** complex change propagation patterns  
**When** visual diff report is generated  
**Then** report should clearly show impact flow  
**And** highlight critical path changes
