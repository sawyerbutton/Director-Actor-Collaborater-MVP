## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Performance Test Suite**:
  - Render 500+ errors simultaneously
  - Complex relationship graphs with 100+ nodes
  - Memory usage monitoring over 30-minute sessions
  - Animation frame rate testing
  
- **Load Testing Scenarios**:
  - 10MB+ script files
  - Real-time filtering with 1000+ items
  - Concurrent visualization updates

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **State Management Tests**:
  - Component synchronization scenarios
  - State recovery after errors
  - Undo/redo functionality
  
- **Security Tests**:
  - XSS payload injection
  - Content sanitization verification
  - CSP compliance

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- UI/UX usability testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- PERF-001: Virtual scrolling and pagination implementation
- SEC-001: Content sanitization for all displayed text
- TECH-001: State management architecture validation

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Render time for visualizations
  - Memory usage trends
  - Frame rate during interactions
  - API response times
  
- **Error Tracking**:
  - JavaScript errors in visualization components
  - Failed parsing attempts
  - State synchronization errors
  
- **User Behavior**:
  - Feature usage patterns
  - Performance bottlenecks
  - Abandonment points

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new visualization types
- Increasing data volume limits
- Changing parsing algorithms
- Upgrading visualization libraries
- Performance complaints from users

## Specific Technical Recommendations

### Visualization Library Choice
**Recommendation**: Use Recharts for basic charts, D3.js for complex relationships
- Recharts: Lower risk, easier maintenance
- D3.js: Higher risk but necessary for relationship graphs
- Avoid mixing multiple libraries to reduce complexity

### Performance Optimization Approach
1. Implement virtual scrolling using react-window
2. Use React.memo aggressively on visualization components
3. Implement request animation frame for smooth updates
4. Add performance budgets (max 100ms response time)

### State Management Strategy
1. Keep visualization state separate from data state
2. Use derived state for filtered/sorted views
3. Implement optimistic updates for instant feedback
4. Add state persistence for recovery

### Security Measures
1. Use DOMPurify for content sanitization
2. Implement strict CSP headers
3. Validate all data before visualization
4. Regular security dependency updates
