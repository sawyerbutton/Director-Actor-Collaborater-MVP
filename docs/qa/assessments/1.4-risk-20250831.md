## Technical Risks

### 1. Performance Degradation (Risk Score: 0.72) üî¥
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** High | **Priority:** P1

**Description:**  
The incremental analysis system processes changes through multiple stages: change tracking, impact analysis, queue management, and concurrent processing. Performance bottlenecks may occur during:
- Large script modifications (>20 scenes)
- Complex dependency resolution
- Cache misses leading to full re-analysis
- Concurrent analysis queue congestion

**Risk Indicators:**
- Analysis time exceeding 10-second NFR1 requirement
- Memory usage spikes during large change processing
- Queue backlog buildup with high-frequency changes
- Cache hit ratio dropping below 70%

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Risk areas in implementation:
private maxConcurrentAnalyses = 3;  // May be insufficient for large scripts
private cacheExpirationMs = 30 * 60 * 1000;  // Cache expiry might be too aggressive
```

### 2. Memory Management Issues (Risk Score: 0.40) üü°
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Priority:** P2

**Description:**  
The system maintains multiple in-memory data structures:
- Analysis queue with task dependencies
- Result cache with 30-minute expiration
- Change history tracking
- Concurrent promise management

**Memory Leak Scenarios:**
- Uncleaned promise references in `activeTasks` map
- Growing cache without proper eviction
- Accumulating change event history
- Circular references in dependency graphs

### 3. Concurrent Processing Race Conditions (Risk Score: 0.48) üü°
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Priority:** P2

**Description:**  
Multiple analysis tasks run concurrently with dependency management. Race conditions may occur in:
- Task status updates during concurrent execution
- Cache read/write operations
- Dependency resolution across parallel tasks
- Result merging from concurrent analyses

**Critical Code Path:**
```typescript
// Potential race condition in executeAnalysisQueue()
const allDependenciesComplete = item.task.dependencies.every(dep => {
  const depTask = Array.from(this.analysisQueue.values())
    .find(i => i.task.targetElement === dep);
  return !depTask || depTask.task.status === 'completed';
});
```

## Business Risks

### 1. Data Consistency Failures (Risk Score: 0.60) üî¥
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Critical | **Priority:** P1

**Description:**  
Inconsistent analysis results between incremental and full analysis modes could lead to:
- Users receiving conflicting recommendations
- Missed critical plot holes or character inconsistencies
- Analysis results not reflecting actual script state

**Business Impact:**
- User trust erosion in AI analysis reliability
- Increased support tickets and user confusion
- Potential data corruption in analysis history

### 2. User Experience Degradation (Risk Score: 0.35) üü°
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium | **Priority:** P3

**Description:**  
Performance issues or system failures may result in:
- Analysis timeouts exceeding user expectations
- Inconsistent loading states during incremental analysis
- Users unable to track analysis progress effectively

---

## Security Risks

### 1. Data Exposure Through Caching (Risk Score: 0.20) üü°
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** Critical | **Priority:** P3

**Description:**  
Cached analysis results contain sensitive script content and may be exposed through:
- Memory dumps during system crashes
- Debugging logs with cached content
- Cache persistence beyond session boundaries

**Mitigation Requirements:**
- Secure memory handling for cached content
- Automatic cache clearing on security events
- Encrypted cache storage if persistence is added

### 2. API Key Exposure (Risk Score: 0.15) üü°
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** Critical | **Priority:** P3

**Description:**  
DeepSeek API keys passed to multiple components could be exposed through:
- Error logs and stack traces
- Debug output during development
- Memory inspection during runtime

---

## Integration Risks

### 1. DeepSeek API Rate Limiting (Risk Score: 0.35) üü°
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium | **Priority:** P3

**Description:**  
Rapid incremental analysis may trigger API rate limits leading to:
- Analysis failures during peak usage
- Cascading retry attempts overwhelming the service
- Inconsistent analysis coverage across script elements

### 2. Dependency Chain Failures (Risk Score: 0.24) üü°
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High | **Priority:** P3

**Description:**  
Integration with Story 1.1-1.3 components may fail due to:
- ConsistencyGuardian availability issues
- ScriptParser format changes
- Type definition mismatches across components

## Mitigation Strategies

### Performance Mitigation
1. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Implement performance metrics collection for analysis times
   - Set up alerts for queue backlog and cache performance
   - Monitor memory usage patterns and garbage collection

2. **Optimization Strategies**

   - Add circuit breaker pattern for API calls
   - Optimize cache eviction policies based on usage patterns

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Graceful degradation to simplified analysis for large changes
   - Queue prioritization for user-facing requests
   - Background preloading for frequently accessed elements

### Data Consistency Mitigation
1. **Validation Framework**
   - Implement cross-validation between incremental and full analysis
   - Add consistency checks for merged results
   - Maintain audit trail for all analysis decisions

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive integration tests with real-world scenarios
   - Load testing with concurrent user modifications
   - Data integrity tests across analysis cycles

### Security Mitigation
1. **Secure Handling**
   - Implement secure string handling for API keys
   - Add memory clearing for sensitive cached content
   - Encrypt analysis results in cache storage

2. **Access Control**
   - Validate user permissions before analysis execution
   - Implement request rate limiting per user
   - Add audit logging for analysis operations
