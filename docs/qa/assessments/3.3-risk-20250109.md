## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Missing Authentication on API Endpoints

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Story mentions "暂时使用模拟认证中间件进行开发", real auth not yet implemented
**Impact**: High - Complete unauthorized access to all user data and operations
**Mitigation**:
- Implement proper NextAuth.js authentication immediately (Story 3.4 dependency)
- Add authentication middleware to ALL endpoints before any testing
- Never deploy to staging/prod without real authentication
**Testing Focus**: Security testing for unauthorized access attempts on all endpoints

### 2. SEC-002: Insufficient Input Validation on Analysis Submission

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Script content accepts arbitrary user input for AI processing
**Impact**: High - Potential for injection attacks, AI prompt manipulation, resource exhaustion
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict Zod validation for script content
- Add content size limits (10MB as specified)
- Sanitize script content before AI processing
- Implement rate limiting on analysis endpoints
**Testing Focus**: Injection testing, payload size testing, rate limit validation

### 3. DATA-001: Async Analysis State Management Risks

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex async workflow with multiple state transitions
**Impact**: High - Lost analysis results, orphaned processes, incorrect state representation
**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust state machine for analysis lifecycle
- Add database transactions for atomic state updates
- Implement cleanup jobs for orphaned analyses
- Add comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
**Testing Focus**: Concurrent request testing, failure recovery testing, state consistency validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Authentication Bypass Testing**: Attempt all endpoints without auth tokens
- **Input Validation Testing**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection on all inputs
- **State Consistency Testing**: Concurrent analysis submissions, race conditions
- **Authorization Testing**: Cross-user resource access attempts
- **Stress Testing**: 1000+ concurrent requests to validate async handling

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Testing**: Database query optimization validation
- **Export Security Testing**: Malicious content in export formats
- **CORS Testing**: Cross-origin request validation
- **Integration Testing**: AI service failure scenarios
- **Load Testing**: Verify <500ms response time requirement

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Pagination Testing**: Edge cases (empty results, beyond last page)
- **Error Message Testing**: Information disclosure validation
- **Documentation Testing**: API contract validation
- **Monitoring Testing**: Logging and alerting verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: Real authentication must be implemented (Story 3.4)
- SEC-002: Input validation and sanitization complete
- DATA-001: Async state management with proper error recovery
- SEC-003: Authorization checks on all resource access
- SEC-004: Proper CORS configuration

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- PERF-001: With database indexes and monitoring
- TECH-001: With circuit breaker and fallback mechanisms
- PERF-002: With streaming responses for large exports
- SEC-005: With basic rate limiting (enhanced later)

### Accepted Risks
- OPS-001: Documentation can be improved iteratively
- BUS-001: Feature flags can control availability

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Security Metrics**: Failed auth attempts, validation errors, suspicious patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, query performance, throughput
- **Error Rates**: 4xx/5xx responses, timeout rates, AI service failures
- **Business KPIs**: Analysis completion rates, export success rates
- **Resource Usage**: Memory consumption, CPU usage, database connections

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Authentication implementation complete (Story 3.4)
- AI service integration complete (Story 1.x)
- Performance testing results available
- Security audit conducted
- Production deployment planned

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Do NOT proceed to staging without real authentication** - Critical security risk
2. Implement comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas before any testing
3. Add database transactions for all state-changing operations
4. Create integration test suite covering all risk scenarios

### Development Focus
1. Prioritize security controls implementation
2. Add extensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Implement proper logging for security events
4. Add request/response validation at all layers

### Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy with feature flags initially
2. Implement gradual rollout with monitoring
3. Have rollback procedures ready
4. Conduct security review before production

### Testing Requirements
1. Security test suite must pass 100%
2. Performance tests must validate <500ms requirement
3. Chaos testing for async workflow resilience
4. Penetration testing before production release
