# ScriptAI MVP - Intelligent Script Analysis Assistant

> An AI-powered collaborative system that helps screenwriters detect and fix common logical errors in scripts within 10 seconds.

## Overview

ScriptAI is a Next.js monolithic application that leverages three collaborative AI agents to analyze scripts and provide intelligent suggestions for improving logical consistency. Built with a "function-first, architecture-second" philosophy after learning from over-engineering failures.

### Key Features

- **Instant Script Analysis**: Detect and fix 5+ types of common logical errors in under 10 seconds
- **AI Agent Collaboration**: Three specialized agents working together for comprehensive analysis
- **Interactive Modifications**: Accept or reject AI suggestions with visual context
- **Continuous Consistency Engine**: Maintains script consistency even after setting changes
- **Clean, Minimal Interface**: Distraction-free writing and editing environment

### Implemented Components

#### âœ… DeepSeek API Integration (Story 1.1)
- Robust API client with exponential backoff retry logic
- Rate limiting to prevent API throttling
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- TypeScript types for all API responses

#### âœ… Script Parser (Story 1.2)
- Supports both Chinese and English scripts
- Extracts scenes, characters, dialogue, and actions
- Security-hardened with XSS prevention
- Outputs structured JSON for AI analysis

#### âœ… Consistency Guardian Agent (Story 1.3)
- Analyzes 5 types of logical errors:
  - Character consistency
  - Timeline continuity
  - Scene consistency
  - Plot coherence
  - Dialogue consistency
- Confidence scoring for each detected issue
- Parallel analysis for performance optimization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or Supabase account)
- DeepSeek API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Director-Actor-Collaborater-MVP.git
cd Director-Actor-Collaborater-MVP
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_api_key"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.
