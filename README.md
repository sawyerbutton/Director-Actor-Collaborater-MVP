## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm
- Docker Desktop (for local PostgreSQL)
- DeepSeek API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Director-Actor-Collaborater-MVP.git
cd Director-Actor-Collaborater-MVP
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up PostgreSQL with Docker:
```bash
# Pull PostgreSQL image
docker pull postgres:16-alpine

# Run PostgreSQL container
docker run -d \
