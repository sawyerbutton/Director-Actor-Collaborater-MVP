# ScriptAI MVP - Intelligent Script Analysis Assistant

> An AI-powered collaborative system that helps screenwriters detect and fix common logical errors in scripts within 10 seconds.

## Overview

ScriptAI is a Next.js monolithic application that leverages three collaborative AI agents to analyze scripts and provide intelligent suggestions for improving logical consistency. Built with a "function-first, architecture-second" philosophy after learning from over-engineering failures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/pnpm
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or Supabase account)
- DeepSeek API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Director-Actor-Collaborater-MVP.git
cd Director-Actor-Collaborater-MVP
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_api_key"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.
